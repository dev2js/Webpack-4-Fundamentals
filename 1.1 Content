Problem without Webpack
Have to deal with global js with 10K lines code or modules of files around 300 files
Other problems are scope, globalizing, modules based.
We can solve multiple modules by Gulp, Grunt, broccoli ... uglyfies the app.
Single file change have to rebuild them and dead code or bottle necks.
Cant do lazy loading
Asynchronous module definition along with Common JS - Too dynamic of Lazy loading
ESM - Import / Export doesnt works with Node and slower in Browser if used directly as they
take time to resolve the dependencies

Webpack
ESM
Module based ecosystem
mode to set along with environment
Watch mode
Treeshaking / Dead Code eliminations

Entry
Loaders(chaining loaders) and Rules
